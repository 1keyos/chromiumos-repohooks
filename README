Disabling ChromiumOS source style checks
===========================================

If your project does not conform to the ChromiumOS source style (80 char lines,
no tabs, ChromiumOS license header, etc.), you can disable the source style
pre-upload hooks by copying the PRESUBMIT.cfg file in
<checkout_dir>/src/repohooks/disable_cros_style_checks to your project root.

The sample config file disables all of the source style checks.  You can comment out the
disable-flags for the checks you want to leave enabled.

Some hints
===========================================

- Get the latest version of the hooks before running 'repo upload', by running
  'repo sync chromiumos/repohooks'.
     - When your hooks change, you will be prompted for permission to run the hooks even
       if you answered 'yes-never-ask-again' previously.
